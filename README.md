# How to Use

Install selenium for python (i'm too lazy to show you how, a quick search will show you)

Download the file, and download the chrome binary for your version of chrome (You can check your version of Chrome by typing `chrome://version`)

### **Download Binary's [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)**

Copy the path of your binary file (should end in chromedriver.exe), and replace the file path in line 7 with that.

Copy the path of your chrome.exe and paste that in line 6.

Run
